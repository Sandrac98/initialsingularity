# Design

## Colour Scheme.
I have decided to go with different shades of purple since it has become associated with the K-pop industry and fan culture, but it's not inherently related to K-pop itself. Instead, the association between purple and K-pop has developed over time due to its popularity among K-pop fans and its frequent use by K-pop artists and fan communities. Here's why purple is often linked to K-pop:

**Purple Hearts**: K-pop fans commonly use purple heart emojis (ðŸ’œ) to express their love and support for their favorite artists. The purple heart symbolizes admiration, affection, and unity within the K-pop fan community.

**Fandom Colors**: Some K-pop groups have designated official fandom colors, and purple is occasionally chosen as one of these colors. When a fandom adopts purple as its color, it becomes a unifying symbol for fans to identify with.

**Lightsticks and Concerts**: At K-pop concerts, fans often use lightsticks that emit purple light. These lightsticks are synchronized with the music and stage lighting, creating a visually stunning and immersive concert experience. Purple light is associated with fan enthusiasm and excitement.

**Fan Art and Fan Projects**: K-pop fans create fan art, banners, and projects that prominently feature purple as a way to show support for their favorite artists. These projects are often displayed during concerts or fan events.

**Social Media Trends**: Purple is a trending color on social media platforms among K-pop fans. Fans use purple-themed profile pictures, hashtags, and emojis to celebrate their favorite artists and interact with the K-pop community.

## W3 Validation Issues

In the development of this project, I encountered and addressed various W3 validation issues. Below are some of the issues that have been fixed:

### 1. Viewport Value Error<a name="viewport-value-error"></a>

**Error Message:** Consider avoiding viewport values that prevent users from resizing documents.

**Explanation:** This error occurs in line 11, column 9 to line 11, column 95. It suggests that the viewport settings may prevent users from resizing the document.

---

### 2. Element li Not Allowed in nav<a name="element-li-not-allowed-in-nav"></a>

**Error Message:** Element li not allowed as a child of element nav in this context.

**Explanation:** This error occurs in multiple places where the `<li>` element is used within a `<nav>` element. According to HTML5 specifications, the `<li>` element is not allowed as a direct child of the `<nav>` element in this context.

---

### 3. Duplicate ID user-options<a name="duplicate-id-user-options"></a>

**Error Message:** Duplicate ID user-options.

**Explanation:** This error indicates that there are duplicate HTML elements with the same `id` attribute value "user-options." It can cause unexpected behavior when accessing elements by their `id`.

---

### 4. Duplicate Attribute class<a name="duplicate-attribute-class"></a>

**Error Message:** Duplicate attribute class.

**Explanation:** This error occurs when multiple HTML elements have duplicate `class` attributes with the same value. Duplicate attributes should be avoided to ensure clean and maintainable code.

---

### 5. Unclosed Elements<a name="unclosed-elements"></a>

**Error Message:** End tag li seen, but there were open elements. / Unclosed element div.

**Explanation:** These errors indicate that certain HTML elements (e.g., `<li>`, `<div>`) are not properly closed, resulting in unclosed elements. Properly closing elements is essential to maintain the document's structure.

---

### 6. Illegal Character in href Attribute<a name="illegal-character-in-href-attribute"></a>

**Error Message:** Bad value /products/?category=Memo pads for attribute href on element a: Illegal character in query: space is not allowed.

**Explanation:** This error points out that the `href` attribute of an anchor `<a>` element contains illegal characters, specifically spaces. URLs should not contain spaces; consider encoding them as `%20`.

---

### 7. Stray end tag nav<a name="stray-end-tag-nav"></a>

**Error Message:** Stray end tag nav.

**Explanation:** This error occurs when an `</nav>` end tag is found without a corresponding opening `<nav>` tag. It suggests that there may be issues with the nesting of HTML elements.

---

### 8. Unnecessary type Attribute<a name="unnecessary-type-attribute"></a>

**Error Message:** The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.

**Explanation:** This warning advises that the `type` attribute is unnecessary for including JavaScript resources. The browser can typically infer the script type, so the `type` attribute can be omitted.

---

### 9. Unclosed div Element<a name="unclosed-div-element"></a>

**Error Message:** Unclosed element div.

**Explanation:** This error indicates that a `<div>` element is not properly closed. Make sure to close all `<div>` elements to maintain the structure of the HTML document.

---

### 10. End tag for body seen<a name="end-tag-for-body-seen"></a>

**Error Message:** End tag for body seen, but there were unclosed elements.

**Explanation:** This error suggests that while the end `</body>` tag is present, there are unclosed HTML elements before it. Ensure that all HTML elements are properly closed before the closing `</body>` tag.
